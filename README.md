I'm a huge nerd :nerd_face: of [vanilla javascript (JS)][all-things-js]. This repository serves as a library of helper functions and boilerplate code written with native javascript and browser APIs instead of major frameworks and libraries.

### On this repo
- `boilerplate-*` are code templates to get started with various patterns and practices.
- `helper-*` are nano-libraries written for various needs and wants which I typically either copy & paste as and when needed.
- `examples/try-*` are partials mixed and matched in order to demonstrate a bit more complexed implementations.

## Getting Started
For minimum requirements, you will need the followings:

- [VS Code][download-vscode] with [Remote - Container][download-remote-container-ext] extension.
- [Docker Desktop][download-docker-desktop]
- A web browser, like [Brave][download-brave] as for javascript playground

[download-brave]: https://brave.com/latest

## Run from Source

With VS Code:
- Run command: Open with Live Server, or
- Click `Go Live` on the status bar

Spin up your favorite browser to visit [localhost:5505/examples/](http://localhost:5505/eamples/)

## Learning Resources

Nowadays, vanilla javascript already cover most of it anyways. And, polyfills are there whenever some random feature doesn't support on the browser.

- [You Don't Need Lodash and Underscore][learning-yagni-repo] shows what vanilla javascript methods and techniques to use instead.
- [Financial Times polyfill repository][learning-polyfills-repo] is good for polyfill code snippets.
- [Writing vanilla JS snippets and examples #30][journal-discussion] for a curated list of online resources referred on these snippets.
